# Lock Mouse Cursor
A mod that locks the mouse cursor in place while playing. \
When using two monitors, this prevents the cursor from accidentally clicking outside the game window and exiting the game.\
\
In the mod's settings, you can also choose whether to lock the mouse to the left or right side of the screen. This allows for 2-player levels to assign each player to a specific side of the screen.
